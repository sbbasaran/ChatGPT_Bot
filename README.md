ChatGpt Bot

This code allows you to create a chatbot using ChatGPT, a language model based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture. It utilizes the Tkinter library to provide a simple user interface. The bot takes user questions and generates responses using the OpenAI API.

Users can enter their questions in the text entry box and receive the bot's answers by clicking the "Ask ChatGpt" button. Additionally, they can clear the displayed responses with the "Clear Answers" button.

To update the API key, users can click the "Update API Key" button and enter a new API key.

It's important to note that the code requires an OpenAI API key to function properly. Users will not be able to access the full functionality of the code without providing an API key.
